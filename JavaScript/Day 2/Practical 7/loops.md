# 🔁 Loops in JavaScript

## 📘 What is a Loop?

A **loop** is used to **repeat a block of code** multiple times based on a condition.  
Loops help reduce code duplication and automate repetitive tasks.

## 🔄 Types of Loops in JavaScript

JavaScript supports several types of loops:

---

## 🔹 1. `for` Loop

- Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
- Useful when the **number of iterations is known** in advance.

---

## 🔹 2. `while` Loop

- Repeats a block of code **as long as a condition is true**.
- Used when the **number of repetitions is not known** in advance.

---

## 🔹 3. `do...while` Loop

- Similar to `while`, but the **code runs at least once** before checking the condition.

---

## 🔹 4. `for...of` Loop

- Used to **iterate over iterable objects** like arrays, strings, etc.
- Returns the **values** of the elements.

---

## 🔹 5. `for...in` Loop

- Used to **iterate over the properties** of an object.
- Returns the **keys (property names)**.

---

## 🛑 Loop Control Statements

### 🔸 `break`
- Exits the loop immediately, even if the condition is still true.

### 🔸 `continue`
- Skips the current iteration and moves to the next cycle of the loop.

## ✅ Summary

| Loop Type     | Use Case                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `for`         | When number of repetitions is known    |
| `while`       | When condition controls the loop       |
| `do...while`  | When code must run at least once       |
| `for...of`    | Iterating over iterable values         |
| `for...in`    | Iterating over object properties       |
| `break`       | To exit a loop early                   |
| `continue`    | To skip the current iteration          |

## 💡 Tip

Choose the loop type based on what you're looping over and whether the number of iterations is fixed or dynamic.
