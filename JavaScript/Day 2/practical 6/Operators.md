# ⚙️ Operators in JavaScript

## 📘 What is an Operator?

An **operator** is a symbol used to perform operations on values (operands).  
JavaScript supports various types of operators for arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logic, and more.

## ➕ 1. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description        |
|----------|--------------------|
| `+`      | Addition            |
| `-`      | Subtraction         |
| `*`      | Multiplication      |
| `/`      | Division            |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)|
| `**`     | Exponentiation      |
| `++`     | Increment           |
| `--`     | Decrement           |

## 🧮 2. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description                  |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `=`      | Assign                        |
| `+=`     | Add and assign                |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign           |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign           |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign             |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign            |
| `**=`    | Exponentiation and assign     |

## 🔍 3. Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values.

| Operator | Description                  |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal (loose comparison)      |
| `===`    | Strictly equal (value + type) |
| `!=`     | Not equal                     |
| `!==`    | Strictly not equal            |
| `>`      | Greater than                  |
| `<`      | Less than                     |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to      |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to         |

## ⚡ 4. Logical Operators

Used to combine Boolean values.

| Operator | Description       |
|----------|-------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND        |
| `||`     | Logical OR         |
| `!`      | Logical NOT        |

---

## 🧠 5. Type Operators

| Operator | Description               |
|----------|---------------------------|
| `typeof` | Returns the type of value |
| `instanceof` | Checks object type    |

---

## 🔄 6. Bitwise Operators

Operate on binary representations.

| Operator | Description       |
|----------|-------------------|
| `&`      | AND                |
| `|`      | OR                 |
| `^`      | XOR                |
| `~`      | NOT                |
| `<<`     | Left shift         |
| `>>`     | Right shift        |
| `>>>`    | Unsigned right shift |

## 🎯 7. Ternary Operator

A short way to write conditionals.

- Syntax: `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`

---

## 📌 8. Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)

Returns the **right-hand value** only if the **left-hand value is null or undefined**.

---

## ✅ Summary

- JavaScript has various operators for different tasks.
- Understanding each type helps in writing better and cleaner logic.
- Some operators (like `===`, `??`, `typeof`) are especially useful in modern JavaScript.
