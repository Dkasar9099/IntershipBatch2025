# ðŸ”¤ Strings in JavaScript

## ðŸ“˜ What is a String?

A **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent text.  
In JavaScript, strings are a **primitive data type** and are enclosed in either **single quotes (' ')**, **double quotes (" ")**, or **backticks (` `)**.

## ðŸ§¾ Ways to Declare a String

- Using single quotes: 'Hello'
- Using double quotes: "World"
- Using backticks (template literals): `Hello World`

Backticks allow **multi-line strings** and **string interpolation** using `${}`.

---

## ðŸ”¢ String Indexing

- Each character in a string has a numeric **index** starting from **0**.
- You can access characters by their index.
- Strings are **immutable**, so characters cannot be changed directly.

---

## ðŸ§° String Properties

- **length**: Returns the total number of characters in the string (including spaces).

| `replace`     | Replaces part of a string                |
| `split`       | Converts string into an array            |
| `slice`       | Extracts part of a string                |
| `charAt`      | Returns the character at a specific index|
| `indexOf`     | Returns the position of a substring      |

## ðŸ§  Characteristics of Strings

- Strings are **immutable**.
- Strings can be **concatenated** (joined together).
- Strings support **escape characters** like `\n`, `\'`, `\"`.

## âœ… Summary

- Strings represent text and are enclosed in `' '`, `" "`, or `` ` ``
- Strings are indexed and immutable.
- JavaScript provides many **built-in methods** to work with strings efficiently.
