# 📚 Arrays in JavaScript

## 📘 What is an Array?

An **array** is a special type of variable that can store **multiple values** in a single variable.  
Each value in an array is called an **element**, and elements are stored in a specific **order**.

---

## 🔢 Array Indexing

- Arrays use **zero-based indexing**.
- The **first element** is at index `0`, the **last** is at index `length - 1`.

---

## 📦 Characteristics of Arrays

- Can hold **any data type**: numbers, strings, booleans, objects, even other arrays.
- Arrays are **mutable** – their content can be changed after creation.
- Arrays have a **length property** that tells how many elements are inside.

## 🧰 Common Array Methods

| Method         | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `push()`       | Adds an element to the **end**                 |
| `pop()`        | Removes the **last** element                   |
| `shift()`      | Removes the **first** element                  |
| `unshift()`    | Adds an element to the **beginning**           |
| `length`       | Returns the total number of elements           |
| `indexOf()`    | Finds the index of a given element             |
| `includes()`   | Checks if an element exists in the array       |
| `join()`       | Converts array elements to a string            |
| `slice()`      | Returns a **portion** of the array             |
| `splice()`     | Adds/removes elements from an array            |
| `reverse()`    | Reverses the order of elements                 |
| `sort()`       | Sorts the elements alphabetically/numerically  |
| `concat()`     | Combines two or more arrays                    |

## 🔁 Looping Through Arrays

Arrays can be looped using:

- `for` loop
- `for...of` loop
- `forEach()` method

## 🔗 Array vs Object

| Feature       | Array                            | Object                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Data Type     | Ordered list                     | Key-value pairs                |
| Access        | By index                         | By key                         |
| Use Case      | List of items                    | Structured data                |

## ✅ Summary

- Arrays store multiple values in one variable.
- Use built-in methods for efficient data handling.
- Arrays are a core part of JavaScript and are widely used in loops, functions, and applications.
