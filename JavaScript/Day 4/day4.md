# ðŸ“˜ Today's Learning â€“ JavaScript Functions & Concepts

---

## ðŸ”¹ Arrow Function

Arrow functions are a **concise way** to write function expressions.  
They do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, or `super`, making them ideal for short, simple operations.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Callback Function

A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function.  
It allows for **deferred execution**, often used in asynchronous operations like API calls, timers, or event handling.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Function Expression

A **function expression** involves assigning a function to a variable.  
Unlike function declarations, they are **not hoisted**, meaning they canâ€™t be used before they are defined.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Default Arguments

JavaScript allows you to set **default values for parameters** in a function definition.  
If a value is not provided when the function is called, the default is used instead.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Function Inside Function

Functions in JavaScript can be **nested** inside other functions.  
The inner function has access to the outer function's variables and parameters.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Function Returning Function

JavaScript functions can **return another function**.  
This is a key feature used in closures and functional programming patterns.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Lexical Scoping

Lexical scope means that a variable defined outside a function is **accessible inside** it, but not vice versa.  
Scope is determined by the **physical placement of code** in the source file.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Mapping

`map()` is an array method used to **transform each element** of an array using a function.  
It returns a **new array** with the transformed values.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Filter

`filter()` is an array method used to **select elements** based on a condition.  
It returns a **new array** containing only the elements that pass the test.

## âœ… Summary

Todayâ€™s learning focused on:
- Modern function syntaxes and behaviors
- Functional programming tools
- Array processing methods (`map`, `filter`)
- Concepts like callbacks, scope, and return functions
