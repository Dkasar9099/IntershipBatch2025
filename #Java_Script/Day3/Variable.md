ðŸ§® Variables in JavaScript
ðŸ”¹ What is a Variable?
A variable is used to store data that can be used and changed during the execution of a program.



ðŸ”‘ Types of Variable Declarations
JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

var â€“ Traditional way (older)

let â€“ Modern and preferred for changeable values

const â€“ Used for values that should not change



ðŸ“¦ Scope and Rules
Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
Re-declaration	Allowed	Not allowed	Not allowed
Re-assignment	Allowed	Allowed	Not allowed
Hoisting	Yes	Yes (but uninitialized)	Yes (but uninitialized)



ðŸ“Œ Best Practices
Use let when the value needs to change.

Use const for fixed values that must not change.

Avoid using var in modern JavaScript code.



âœ… Summary
Variables are containers for storing data.

Use meaningful and descriptive names.

Always prefer let and const for clean, modern code.
